\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. Why is it important for instance variables to be private?\
\
   Instance variables being private is important for encapsulation. By making instance variables private, we hide the\
   internal details of a class and expose only necessary functionalities through public methods.\
   This helps in preventing unintended modifications and ensures better control over the class's behavior, making the code more maintainable.\
\
2. Propose your own new method for the Geniegotchi class. Provide its signature and\
   describe what it does (what it takes, what it returns, etc.). You do not have to implement it.\
\
   Signature:\
   public void rest()\
\
   Description:\
   The rest method simulates the Geniegotchi taking a rest to regain endurance and happiness.\
   It doesn't take any parameters and doesn't return anything. The method increases both\
   endurance and happiness by a certain amount, allowing the Geniegotchi to recover and improve its mood. \
   This method provides an additional way for users to maintain the well-being of their Geniegotchi.\
